Window:-

* The window object is the top-level object in the browser's Document Object Model (DOM). It represents the browser window 
or tab and serves as the global object in the client-side JavaScript environment.
* The window object provides access to a wide range of properties and methods for managing and controlling the browser window, 
including opening and closing windows, navigating to URLs, handling events such as clicks and keypresses, and interacting with 
frames and iframes.

Screen:-

* The screen object represents the user's screen or monitor. It provides information about the user's screen properties, including
screen dimensions, color depth, pixel density, and more.
* Developers often use the screen object to optimize web content for different screen sizes and resolutions or to determine the 
available screen space for positioning elements, particularly in scenarios where the design and layout of a web page need to adapt
to varying screen sizes.

Document:-

* The document object represents the web page or HTML document currently loaded in the browser window. It offers access to the 
structure and content of the document, allowing you to manipulate and modify the Document Object Model (DOM).
* Developers use the document object to access and manipulate HTML elements, create, delete, or update content on the web page,
and respond to user interactions. It's an essential object for building dynamic and interactive web applications.
